## Instructions to use

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Navigate to `api` directory, and update `.env` file with the following:

```sh
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=<your-django-secret-key>
DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
LOG_REQUESTS=true

APCA_API_SECRET_KEY=<your-alpaca-secret-key>
APCA_API_KEY_ID=<your-alpaca-api-key>
APCA_API_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets

POSTGRES_USER=tradingbot
POSTGRES_NAME=tradingbot
POSTGRES_DB=tradingbot
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust
```
**Note:** setting `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust` means postgresql does not require a password. This is used only in development mode, being run on localhost

2. Run `docker-compose up` to initialise postgres for databasing, and celery/celery-beat/redis for handling of background tasks.

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

3. Run the api on localhost a separte terminal

```sh
$ pipenv shell
$ python manage.py runserver
```
