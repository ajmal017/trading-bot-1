Trades are placed with Alpaca Paper trading platform, with market data periodically sourced using Docker containers with Celery and Redis, and stored in a Postgresql database.

## Instructions to use

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Create your own [Alpaca Api Account](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup).

2. Create a `.env` file in your `server` directory. Copy the include `.env.example` in this repo for a starter file;

```sh
$ cp .env.example .env
```

**Note:** setting `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust` means postgresql does not require a password. This is used only in development mode, being run on localhost

2. Activate your virtual environment, and install the necessary dependencies summarised in the `Pipfile`

```sh
$ pipenv shell
$ pipenv install
```

3. Run `docker-compose up` to initialise postgres for databasing, and celery/celery-beat/redis for handling of background tasks.

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

3. Run the server on localhost a separte terminal and run database migrations, create a superuser (I use the `.env` file for superuser details, and include `--no-input` command)

```sh
$ pipenv shell
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py createsuperuser --no-input
$ python manage.py runserver
```

$ python manage.py test server
