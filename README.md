# **Trading Bot**

Algorithmic trading bot using market data from [Alpaca API](https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/) for real time data subscription/a paper trading account, and implemented using a bespoke Django wrapper for Alpaca's Python client.

Trades are placed with Alpaca Paper trading platform, with market data periodically sourced using Docker containers running Celery and Redis, and stored using a Postgresql database.

# **Alpaca API**

Alpaca Data API provides the market data available to the client user through the REST and websocket streaming interfaces. Alpaca Data API consolidates data sources from five different exchanges.

# Instructions

## Client

1. TBC

## Server

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Create your own [Alpaca API Account](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup).

2. Navigate to your `server` directory, and create a `.env` file. Copy the included `.env.example` in this repo for a starter file;

```sh
$ cd server
$ cp .env.example .env
```

**Note:** setting `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust` means Postgresql does not require a password. This is used only in development mode, being run on localhost

3. Activate your virtual environment, and navigate back into your project folder if necessary

```sh
$ pipenv shell
```

4. Run `docker-compose up` to initialise django server, postgres for databasing, and celery/celery-beat/redis for handling of background tasks.

```sh
$ (server) docker-compose up
```

Note: you may have to give `wait-for-it.sh` and `docker-entrypoint.sh` executable permissions

```sh
$ (server) chmod +x ./wait-for-it.sh && chmod +x ./docker-entrypoint.sh
```

5. To run the server for the first time, you will have to run database migrations and create a superuser (refer `.env.example` file for default superuser account details). To do this you can use `docker-compose` and the `web` container

```sh
$ (server) docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
$ (server) docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser --no-input
```

# Testing

## Server


```sh
$ (server) docker-compose exec web python manage.py test server
```

- Optionally add `--keepdb` to persist database between tests, and `--verbosity=2` to recieve verbose output of tests

```sh
$ (server) docker-compose exec web python manage.py test server --keepdb --verbosity=2
```

## Client

```sh
$ TBC
```

# Server Dependencies

```
[packages]
django
djangorestframework
django-environ
alpaca-trade-api
django-filter
celery
django-celery-beat
psycopg2
psycopg2-binary

[dev-packages]
django-debug-toolbar
freezegun
```

# Note

To make running `docker-compose` commands on your local machine easier, you can use alias' in your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` configuration files eg.

```sh
# ~/.zshrc file
[...]
alias pm="docker-compose exec web python manage.py"
```

Then the command `docker-compose exec web python manage.py test server` becomes `pm test server`
