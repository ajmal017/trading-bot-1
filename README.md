# Instructions

## Client

1. TBC

## Server

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Create your own [Alpaca API Account](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup).

2. Navigate to your `server` directory, and create a `.env` file. Copy the included `.env.example` in this repo for a starter file;

```sh
$ cd server
$ cp .env.example .env
```

**Note:** setting `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust` means Postgresql does not require a password. This is used only in development mode, being run on localhost

3. Activate your virtual environment, and install the necessary dependencies summarised in the `Pipfile`

```sh
$ pipenv shell
$ (sever) pipenv install
```

4. Run `docker-compose up` to initialise postgres for databasing, and celery/celery-beat/redis for handling of background tasks.

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

5. Run the server on localhost a separte terminal and run database migrations, create a superuser (refer `.env.example` file for default superuser account details, and include `--no-input` command)

```sh
$ (server) python manage.py migrate
$ (server) python manage.py createsuperuser --no-input
$ (server) python manage.py runserver
```

# Testing

## Server

```sh
$ (server) python manage.py test server
```

- Optionally add `--keepdb` to persist database between tests, and `--verbosity=2` to recieve verbose output of tests

```sh
$ (server) python manage.py test server --keepdb --verbosity=2
```

## Client
